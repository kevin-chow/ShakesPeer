# ShakesPeer

## Installation:
1. Make sure you have node, [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/), and npm installed. 
2. Make sure all node packages are installed by running `npm install` in both the root directory 
as well as under `angular-src/shakespeer/`. 
3. Under `angular-src/shakespeer/`, run `npm build` to build the front-end files, which will create
a folder named `dist` in the same directory.
4. Back in the root directory, run `node app.js` to start the express server.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to access the website. 

## Development:
- If you're just working on the front-end (Angular), you can run `ng serve` to load a dev server 
that will automatically reload the front-end when changes are made. Navigate to 
`http://localhost:4200/` to access the website.
